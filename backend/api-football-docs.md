Leagues
Leagues
Get the list of available leagues and cups.

The league id are unique in the API and leagues keep it across all seasons

To get the logo of a competition you have to call the following url: https://media.api-sports.io/football/leagues/{league_id}.png

This endpoint also returns the coverage of each competition, which makes it possible to know what is available for that league or cup.

The values returned by the coverage indicate the data available at the moment you call the API, so for a competition that has not yet started, it is normal to have all the features set to False. This will be updated once the competition has started.

You can find all the leagues ids on our Dashboard.

Example :

"coverage": {
  "fixtures": {
      "events": true,
      "lineups": true,
      "statistics_fixtures": false,
      "statistics_players": false
  },
  "standings": true,
  "players": true,
  "top_scorers": true,
  "top_assists": true,
  "top_cards": true,
  "injuries": true,
  "predictions": true,
  "odds": false
}
In this example we can deduce that the competition does not have the following features: statistics_fixtures, statistics_players, odds because it is set to False.

The coverage of a competition can vary from season to season and values set to True do not guarantee 100% data availability.

Some competitions, such as the friendlies, are exceptions to the coverage indicated in the leagues endpoint, and the data available may differ depending on the match, including livescore, events, lineups, statistics and players.

Competitions are automatically renewed by the API when a new season is available. There may be a delay between the announcement of the official calendar and the availability of data in the API.

For Cup competitions, fixtures are automatically added when the two participating teams are known. For example if the current phase is the 8th final, the quarter final will be added once the teams playing this phase are known.

Examples available in Request samples "Use Cases".

Most of the parameters of this endpoint can be used together.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated several times a day.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per hour.

TBD	Time To Be Defined	Scheduled	Scheduled but date and time are not known
NS	Not Started	Scheduled	
1H	First Half, Kick Off	In Play	First half in play

CANC	Match Cancelled	Cancelled	Cancelled, match will not be played
ABD	Match Abandoned	Abandoned	Abandoned for various reasons (Bad Weather, Safety, Floodlights, Playing Staff Or Referees), Can be rescheduled or not, it depends on the competition
AWD	Technical Loss	Not Played	
WO	WalkOver	Not Played	Victory by forfeit or absence of competitor
LIVE	In Progress	In Play	Used in very rare cases. It indicates a fixture in progress but the data indicating the half-time or elapsed time are not available
Fixtures with the status TBD may indicate an incorrect fixture date or time because the fixture date or time is not yet known or final. Fixtures with this status are checked and updated daily. The same applies to fixtures with the status PST, CANC.

The fixtures ids are unique and specific to each fixture. In no case an ID will change.

Not all competitions have livescore available and only have final result. In this case, the status remains in NS and will be updated in the minutes/hours following the match (this can take up to 48 hours, depending on the competition).

Although the data is updated every 15 seconds, depending on the competition there may be a delay between reality and the availability of data in the API.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 15 seconds.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per minute for the leagues, teams, fixtures who have at least one fixture in progress otherwise 1 call per day.

Statistics
Get players statistics.

This endpoint returns the players for whom the profile and statistics data are available. Note that it is possible that a player has statistics for 2 teams in the same season in case of transfers.

The statistics are calculated according to the team id, league id and season.

You can find the available seasons by using the endpoint players/seasons.

To get the squads of the teams it is better to use the endpoint players/squads.

The players id are unique in the API and players keep it among all the teams they have been in.

In this endpoint you have the rating field, which is the rating of the player according to a match or a season. This data is calculated according to the performance of the player in relation to the other players of the game or the season who occupy the same position (Attacker, defender, goal...). There are different algorithms that take into account the position of the player and assign points according to his performance.

This endpoint returns in-play odds for fixtures in progress.

Fixtures are added between 15 and 5 minutes before the start of the fixture. Once the fixture is over they are removed from the endpoint between 5 and 20 minutes. No history is stored. So fixtures that are about to start, fixtures in progress and fixtures that have just ended are available in this endpoint.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 5 seconds.*

* This value can change in the range of 5 to 60 seconds

INFORMATIONS ABOUT STATUS

    "stopped": false, // True if the fixture is stopped by the referee for X reason
    "blocked": false, // True if bets on this fixture are temporarily blocked
    "finished": false // True if the fixture has not started or if it is finished
},
INFORMATIONS ABOUT VALUES

When several identical values exist for the same bet the main field is set to True for the bet being considered, the others will have the value False.

The main field will be set to True only if several identical values exist for the same bet.
